The program is a powerful and interactable web app that allows users to virsualize game data and customize the data sets based on their own desires by controling parameters in each topic. 

*   We ranked the Tier list for all operators in the current season. Users can explore their intensities in different conditions ( platform, game mode, map ... ). 

*   We calculate score for each operator in details based on their performance in games. Their scores depend on four dimensions such as Win Rate, Popularity, Kill (average), Survival. Users can choose their favorite operators and look them in details. 

*   We also provide the analysis for many different possible factors about the Win rate. Try to help user to improve their win rates as much as possible in each game.
